/**
 * Feature Components Barrel Export
 *
 * Central export for all feature-specific components.
 * Feature components will be organized by domain (e.g., shopping-lists, pantry, etc.)

 * import { ShoppingListCard } from '@/components/features';
 * ```

// Feature components will be added as they are implemented
// Example:
